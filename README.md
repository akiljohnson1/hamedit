A php file editor

HamEdit is a one page script that can handle the day to day file maintenance of a php server.  Filesystem handling and Text editing is all possible with a simple interface, and all calls are handled asynchronously for a smooth workflow.

THIS SCRIPT IS DISTRIBUTED ON AN AS IS BASIS.  I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF YOU DELETE YOUR BUTT.

Before you can do anything, you'll need to open the script in a text editor, and change the PASSWORD definition on line 13 of the minified script, or line 25 of the production script.

There are two versions of the script and each version has both a production and minified version.  The minified versions aren't much better, but they're condensed a bit. The -d version has dependencies for jquery and underscore, and will pull these from the web.  This version is not good for offline use.  The other versions have jquery and underscore baked into them.  These versions are a bit larger, but they will run anywhere.
